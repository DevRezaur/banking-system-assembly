# Banking System in Assembly Language with File Input

This is a fun assignment that I had to submit during my academic course on microprocessors. 
I must say writing assembly code is tougher than it seems. But nonetheless, I managed to 
finish the code in just 1 hour :sunglasses: . Kind of proud with that. Thats why I'm putting 
it here. In case anyone finds it useful (just showing off :sweat_smile:)
