### Banking System in Assembly Language with File Read

This is a fun assignment that I had to submit during my academic course on microprocessors. 
I must say writing assembly code is tougher than it seems. But nonetheless, I managed to 
finish the code in just 1 hour :sunglasses: . Kind of proud with that. Thats why I'm putting 
that here. In case anyone finds it useful (just showing off :sweat_smile:)

### Incase anyone wish to run it

* Download EMU8086 Emulator from [here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/download)
* Install it in the default directory (C:/emu8086).
* Go to C:/emu8086/MyBuild And paste the BALANCE.txt and ACCOUNT.txt file there.
* Run it from the EMU8086 emulator :smile:
